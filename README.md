# UPE Decomposer — Unified Prime Equation (UPE)

This repository hosts the **UPE Goldbach Decomposer**, a lightweight demo site running fully in the browser via GitHub Pages.

## 🔢 Calculator
Enter any even number E ≥ 4 and UPE finds a Goldbach pair (p, q) near the midpoint.

### ⚠️ Notes
- This implementation is by **Bahbouhi Bouchaib** (Independent mathematician, Nantes, France).  
- Safe and responsive up to ~10¹².  
- Beyond that, use the forthcoming **giant-number UPE repo**.  
- For certified primality, run ECPP/Primo outside the browser.
